Welcome to my assessment project! This project is built using Django, Bootstrap, and an SQLite database.

To run the project, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment with the command: py -m venv env
3. Activate the virtual environment
4. Install the required dependencies using: pip install -r requirements.txt
5. Start the project with: py manage.py runserver
   
For the best experience, I recommend using Python version 3.12.6 for smooth dependency installation.

Thank you for your interest!
